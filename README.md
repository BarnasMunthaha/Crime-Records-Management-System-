Crime Records Management System

Java | Hibernate | MySQL | Maven

A backend-driven console application for managing crime records, FIRs, victims, and criminal data using Hibernate ORM and MySQL. Built with clean layered architecture (Model → DAO → Service → Controller).

Overview

The Crime Records Management System (CRMS) digitizes crime record management by enabling Admins and Officers to securely manage crimes, victims, criminals, and FIRs.
Hibernate ORM handles object–relational mapping, while MySQL ensures reliable data storage.

The project demonstrates real-world backend development using modular design, authentication, CRUD operations, and relational mapping.
